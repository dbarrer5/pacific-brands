“Thanks very much for the ride, George!” She waved goodbye to her driver as he pulled back into traffic onto Burwood
Road. “Always a pleasure, Madam - call me when you are ready to go home, or if your staff throws you out for being
overdressed!”
Sue Morphet could not help musing over her quick change in scenery from earlier today. As he pulled off, she saw the
platinum satin gown she was still wearing from the formal luncheon she had attended earlier in the afternoon. The
gown reflected perfectly in the onyx-tinted window of his limo. Looking around now, she was a long way from the glitter
of Rosemount Australian Fashion Week in Sydney. She was a little bit relieved actually, happy to be back to the
scrappier location of her own PBG headquarters, and she took stock of it now. She surveyed the 270-degree view
blocked only by PBG’s building. The landscape was a motley collection of random industries: a regional petroleum
company office, a law practice, and a large religious center. Yes, they were all where she had left them, and now they
welcomed her back.
George knew Fashion Week was draining for Sue – she was already feeling its effects. She appreciated the creativity of
it all, but the truth was she cared more about her own organization and keeping it running smoothly for the sake of
her own employees, than she did about the champagne-and-caviar of Sydney. George warned her that she looked too
fancy to go back to the office, but Sue wanted to get back into a work routine her travel fatigue won out against the
freshness Fashion Week still had in her mind.
Background
In her last meeting with Pacific Brand Limited’s (PBG) Board of Directors, Sue Morphet, PBG’s Chief Executive Officer,
had updated the Board about the company’s half-year results for 2009 (see Exhibit 1). Results were lackluster: sales
were down 5.2% from FY2008, and net profits after taxes were down 0.9%. Net sales for the Underwear & Hosiery
operating group had fallen 1.4% from 2007 figures despite strong performances by the Bonds, Berlei, and Hosiery
brands. There also continued to be significant uncertainty about PBG’s future earning potential, because consumers
seemed to be trading down from department store-grade product line into discount store brands and private labels.
On the supply side, unfavorable changes in the exchange rate between Australian and U.S. currency also made
sourcing costlier, giving the company little flexibility on the price front.
Sue was particularly worried about two of PBG’s new products, Infinity and Timeless, which had both just been
launched under the Berlei umbrella. Both targeted fashion-conscious, female consumers seeking a high-end product.
Sue had supported Berlei’s aggressive outreach to this consumer profile, largely because of the flexibility and price
inelasticity associated with the customer. In addition, with such a consumer in-hand, PBG could showcase advances
in its abilities to reach the most creative and technologically advanced customer. Some of the improvements PBG
could pursue on the target customer’s behalf included greater technological manufacturing precision in fabrics, with
cognizance toward accommodating body-fitting angles. Flexibility and choice other improvements the company was
well-positioned to offer, thanks to PBG’s control of its manufacture and design. It had also implemented a number of
cost-cutting measures that allowed it to grow customer variety without losing control of its supply chain. Infinity
targeted young women who sought color variety and saw a brassiere as an opportunity to make a fashion statement,
while Timeless pursued women in their late thirties and early forties who were “young at heart” and wanted to look
sportier and younger. In both cases, style variety would be key to the lines’ success.
Despite PBG’s understanding of the above segments, a struggling economic environment had dampened brand allure
in general and any legitimacy that Infinity and Timeless would normally inherit from Berlei in particular. Women seemed

less willing to pay more for stylish lingerie. Sue knew that lingerie was one of the few industries that could escape a
recession relatively unscathed, but she also knew she would need a shrewd strategy to protect profits without
undercutting quality. She also knew that given a spiraling economy, the company would have to promote Timeless and
Infinity very aggressively but resist the temptation of running gimmicks to excite the customer. The company knew
from experience that gimmicks raised awareness but not necessarily sales among consumers, and that this would be
doubly true in the current economic climate.
To address the dual challenges of the market’s austerity and a factious C-suite at PBG, Sue would need to call upon
lessons she had learned from her many years at PBG. As General Manager of Bonds, the company’s most iconic line
of men’s underwear, she had made the pivotal decision to launch a women’s Bonds line as well. A well-executed
strategy, Bonds nearly doubled its sales, and Sue found herself on the fast track to her current role as CEO.
Sue’s Chief Marketing Officer, Mark Baxter, had now been with PBG close to two years. While PBG had not yet set him
onto a large campaign, he had proven himself in the industry working with the Hanes and Fruit of the Loom brands
prior to joining PBG. Sue trusted Mark’s judgment both as a marketer and an industry expert. As PBG was now
emerging from an intensive two-year restructuring, Mark had approached her with a segmentation strategy that would
improve the way PBG identified and targeted customers for its different brands. Upon hearing of this, PBG’s CFO, Kevin
LaSalle had immediately intervened. Kevin argued strongly that developing a separate marketing program for each
target segment would be a waste of resources. He felt that since most consumers looking for Infinity or Timeless
shopped at the same outlets, the brands would naturally cross-market as women saw them side-by-side at their
retailers. The company had already sunk a massive number of resources into dealing with operational changes to
accommodate dozens of additional SKUs over the last season alone, and Kevin saw Mark’s segmentation strategy as
a way to use up scarce cash flows during the tightest economy he had yet seen as PBG’s CFO. Kevin also cited the
growth of the discount store segment, which was far greater than any other segment, to bolster his argument that
now was not the time to fragment the company’s marketing program and resources. He believed that PBG should cut
costs wherever possible to preserve funds as long as the global economy and consumer spending were suffering.
In the meantime, Mark was going home shell-shocked daily, wondering, “What did I get myself into? I am getting paid
too much not to contribute here, and I have been waiting now for nearly two years. I should be moving the company
forward. I never dreamed I would be fighting for my team to undertake something as basic as a segmentation strategy.
It will be on my head if consumers do not respond to the lines – who does he think he is, telling me not to segment
my customers?” Kevin, having been burned in the past and afraid of having to shore up PBG through a possible
recession, is not about to budge on this. He did not want to be in the same situation he had been in with Mark’s
predecessor, Jeff Hindiger. Kevin had had it with marketers who thought they were media stars and just wanted
limelight for PBG or for themselves.
Sue knew that she had to either steer Mark and Kevin toward an agreement or decide herself how to keep PBG
competitive in the new normal of a slow, extended period of economic recovery. The irony was that she had brought
Mark into PBG originally because of his reputation as a numbers man. She was convinced that both officers were
exactly the right individuals for their roles and for this moment in time. She would simply have to convince them how
to talk to one another: in figures.

Australian Retail Women’s Wear Market
The Australian retail apparel industry fragmented into many small retailers, though some national chains used
department or discount store formats. The market was driven by large wholesalers like PBG that specialized in both
sourcing and brand management. Because the wholesalers controlled popular brands, retailers had little choice but
to accommodate a wholesaler-led supply chain. Intimate apparel had long been dominated by PBG and Gazal, both
of which used their economies of scale and diversified corporate expertise to build their respective brands.
This forced multiple retail outlets to carry their products. However, by 2008, distribution trends were shifting. This shift
was due to three major forces: (1) department store consolidation, plus a focus on private labels within those stores;
(2) declining consumer spending due to a slower economy; and (3) global discount retailers entering Australia, which
were accustomed to utilizing their own supplier networks. As a result of the economy, manufacturers began
abandoning low-margin brands, while – conversely – consumers began demanding more benefits at lower prices. To
add to the confusion, the average Australian consumer was profiled as time-poor, convenience driven, and often away
from home to either work or to socialize, though shopping-as-leisure remained a popular outing among Australian
consumers.1 This consumer also paid attention to where clothes were made, and she had a perception of which
brands were best. Both these points represented opportunities for increased competition among retailers.
Even with an increase in online shopping and general decline in the Australian retail market, the sale of women’s wear
continued to drive the retail apparel market more than men’s or infant apparel sales. Online purchases of apparel had
increased from 20% in 2005 to 33% in 2008. Women’s wear generated total revenues of $6.9 billion in 2007, or 58.6%
of the total Australian apparel market, while men’s wear generated only $4.4 billion, or 37.4% of the market. According
to Data Monitor, the Australian women’s wear market grew by 2.2% in 2007, reaching a value of $4.9 billion in profits
and $6.9 billion in revenues. However, the 5.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the women’s wear market
from 2003 to 2007 was expected to slow down from 2008 onward in response to the global economic slump (see
Exhibits 2a and 2b), so all retail suppliers would have to compete fiercely for a piece of this decreasing pie. At PBG,
Kevin was intently aware of this dynamic. It had been almost two years since the start of the downturn, and he was
still awaiting a retail resurgence lead by consumers.
Another Australian consumer pattern was that women spent more of their disposable income on clothing and were
more likely than men to purchase fashionable items that were high-priced.2 The range of offerings to this demographic
in the market continued to grow, and retailers sought perpetual changeability for their stock as well as more fashion
seasons per year. In addition, recent consolidation in the retail industry had granted retailers more market and buying
power than they were accustomed to in the Australian market, especially for low- to moderately-priced merchandise.
High-volume discount chains, such as Walmart, Costco, H&M, and Primark, offered additional low-cost, “fast-fashion”
brands. They sourced clothing directly from suppliers with whom they had existing relationships. In contrast to the
customary supply chain in Australia, this added flexibility to their strategies to reach both the budget-conscious
consumer and the “clotheshound.”3

More than 70% of women’s apparel sales represented dresses, skirts, and trousers (47.4%) or blouses and other tops
(25.7%). Despite low switching costs for the consumer, shoppers tended to respond favorably to branding and
advertising efforts, which had the potential to increase loyalty toward a favorite designer instead of to a retailer. A large
market for non-designer women’s wear also attracted the less affluent customer to department stores, so designers
depended on retailers to encourage the consumption of branded products. This was not necessarily to the retailer’s
benefit.4

Underwear and hosiery made up only 14.8% of the women’s wear market (see Exhibit 3), and differentiation among a
vast range of global and local brands required the achievement of an optimal product mix (see Exhibits 4 & 5). In an
effort to define this mix, PBG had invested increasingly in intimate apparel brands that targeted fashion- and styleconscious women. This targeting had become potentially lucrative only recently, because the “social visibility” of bras
had increased in response to fashion trends that showcased bras as part of an apparel ensemble. This important
trend quickly moved brassiere design to the fore, which in turn led to increased consumer demand for contemporary,
stylish bra straps, new fabrics, and improved precision of fit. Sue had seen evidence of this at Rosemount this week
and was relieved that she had already led PBG to address it so aggressively over the past few years.
Overview and Strategy of Pacific Brands
Pacific Brands originated in 1893 as Pacific Dunlop, a manufacturer of bicycle tires. In the 1920s, the company
expanded into the manufacture of rubber boots and later entered the outerwear and underwear categories as well
(see Exhibit 6). In the early 1990s, the company restructured, leaving the Dunlop family of brands to specialize in tires,
safety, and health products, and the newly formed Pacific Brands to focus on wholesale distribution and brand
management of consumer lifestyle brands.
Through a large house of brands, PBG aimed to address consumer lifestyle needs for the underwear, socks, hosiery,
intimate apparel, footwear, bed linens and accessories, foam, corporate uniforms, workwear, streetwear, lifestyle
apparel, and sporting goods markets (see Exhibit 7). The vast majority of its sales occurred in the Asia-Pacific region,
and the company maintained four operating groups: (1) Underwear & Hosiery (U&H); (2) Workwear; (3) Footwear,
Outerwear & Sport; and (4) Homewares. In FY2008, Underwear & Hosiery represented the second-highest contributor
to PBG sales at 30.1%; U&H also experienced 3.3% sales growth during 2008 and became the clear market leader in
Australia in the category. Berlei, Bonds, and Hestia represented the top three brands for the region, the category, and
within PBG. In short, PBG dominated women’s intimates.
In 2008, PBG divested to the tune of $27 million in low-performing brands in response to findings from a strategic
review of the company conducted earlier that year. The review concluded that PBG had overall (1) too many brands,
(2) too much complexity, (3) significant excess costs, (4) limited uniformity of process and procedures, and (5) no
significant organic growth.5
It recommended that PBG pursue cost savings through outsourcing and best-in-business
processes. In addition, PBG realized that smaller businesses were succeeding by providing fewer, but more profitable
brands, than was PBG’s norm. PBG decided to follow suit and dump its low-margin brands to compete more effectively
and build profit reserves.
In 2009, however, the company’s overall sales declined significantly anyway. Volume through department stores
represented the greatest decline (see Exhibit 8), though PBG saw growth in discount department store sales. This
change in sales distribution reflected a shift in consumer spending patterns as well as of locations where the consumer
thought to seek out PBG products. Despite these setbacks, the Board had supported Sue in continuing forward with
PBG’s restructuring efforts toward a more consolidated operation. The focus of the PBG 2010 strategy was a brand
restructuring taking into account the given data: (1) top 20 PBG brands contribute 67% of sales, (2) top 10 contribute
40% of sales, and (3) top 5 contribute 33%. In 2008, more than 200 PBG brands had contributed to only 2% of the
company’s sales. Mark wondered if he should reach out and tell Kevin how much he supported Kevin’s leadership and
analyses during the decision to refocus on fewer brands. After all, that was essentially the same goal Mark was trying
to achieve through his segmentation study.

As Exhibit 9 highlights, the 2010 strategy focused on increasing marketing and manufacturing efficiencies, and the
company decided to focus its efforts and resources on more profitable brands. In addition to discontinuing brands,
PBG closed seven manufacturing sites in Australia and moved production functions to China. This resulted in 1,200
layoffs in Australia, which led to a rash of bad publicity for PBG due to the sense of pride Australians took in purchasing
Australian-made products.
Berlei
The Berlei group offered three intimate apparel brands—Berlei, Playtex, and Hestia—that catered to various levels of
functionality and fashion including Everyday, Everyday Special, Full-figure, Maternity, Post-surgery, and Sport products.
From its beginnings in the early twentieth century, Berlei had always been an innovator. From developing the first
physician-designed corset to the development of the Figure Type Indicator facilitating a perfect fit, and from the Gothic
bra to Australia’s first maternity bra (see Exhibit 10), Berlei had served a wide variety of consumer preferences.
However, while the brand had often self-identified as a luxury bra brand, consumers often perceived it as an economy
brand (see Exhibit 11). Among its competitors, Calvin Klein, offered by PBG’s closest competitor, Gazal Corporation,
had communicated greater luxury appeal consistently to consumers, and had captured two categories in the same
price–fashion matrix: the high-priced traditional practical and the upper-brand functional sport. Gazal portrayed its
brands with more class than Berlei did, according to the perceptions of the highly influential “fashionista” constituency
at Fashion Week and other leading-edge events throughout Australia.
PBG Retailing & Advertising Strategies
Advertising and Promotions
PBG’s foremost goal going forward was to grow customer loyalty in the midst of an increasingly competitive and
decreasingly loyal selling environment. However, a concerted attempt to build awareness in 2008 via the “Great Shape
Bus” campaign did not lead to greater loyalty. The GSB was a specially designed, red charter bus that had roamed
Australia, making stops throughout the country to demonstrate the fit, comfort, and glamour of a Berlei bra. It was
viewed at the time by the media as a hugely successful campaign and by the company as one of the most successful
since the “only the ball should bounce” billboard campaign of 2000, with tennis champion Anna Kournikova. However,
the buzz generated by the Great Shape Bus tour did not translate into “infinite” or “timeless” sales. PBG needed
something more to attract not only a customer’s curiosity, but also her wallet.
Sue thought back to that promotion, to Jeff, her prior CMO, and to the night Kevin came into her office wondering what
in the world Jeff was thinking. Jeff had been an idea man and had come from a media background. He had been the
perfect person to lead a national, highly visible campaign. In retrospect, Sue thought just now, he had not had the
necessary analytical grounding to build a media event strategically and profitably. After the tour, she had gracefully
redistributed him into a media management role, where he had since thrived, and brought in Mark. Kevin, however,
was reticent to appreciate any CMO after GSB, and Sue did not blame him for being cautious.
To compete more effectively and frugally, PBG was now ramping up its online efforts. It had invested in creating new
content for the Berlei website such as consumer tools like the Lingerie Guide; the Style Finder; an index by feature
descriptions of a bra; and a searchable database designed to make online bra buying simple and fun. Both applications
also featured a complete color catalog with product photographs and engaging, interactive features. Mark had been

directly responsible for cultivating a climate of competitive research that had led to the marketing team’s
developments of these leading-edge tools for the consumer, and Kevin could see the payoffs from these efforts in
online sales figures.
The company had also recognized the emergence of digital technology as a tool for “short-term branding,” and as an
information source that influences off-line sales. Although television and magazines might remain the best long-term
branding solutions, in-store and in-transit media including text messaging and other social media, were on the rise. In
particular, “[m]edia that are on the way to the retail environment—which can include radio and transit advertising if
the person is on the way to the shops, and also includes advertising in the car park and entry points to shopping
malls—act as a short-term brand recall zone.”6
To support the kind of demand and variety an advanced online presence would require, PBG set out to introduce
more new styles than its competitors. Sue had hoped this would allow it to set trends and drive changes in the industry
in the most aggressive manner possible. PBG’s recent production move to China gave the company a cost advantage
that would make it more plausible than ever to produce more style and color variety than its competitors.
Competitors and Retailer Relations
The PBG + retailer equation was also becoming more crucial for brand success as internet-based buying had gained
greater acceptance in late 2000s. The democratic nature of the internet also meant that more small retailers and
online sellers would enter market spaces they might not have been able to reach previously. These sellers might have
a critical advantage offering a wide variety of brands without the expense of maintaining brick-and-mortar overhead.
This meant more competition for PBG. In addition, by exploiting the labor of staff in existing outlets or remotely, smaller
players could maximize profit opportunities for themselves. PBG would have to compete with these players, and she
needed all her divisions to understand the urgency of this change in the competitive landscape. She needed Mark’s
attention to be on this landscape like a hawk, but she knew he would stop looking as intently at it if he could not use
some basic market analysis techniques to move forward.
Another strategic issue that presented itself if PBG increased its SKU count was that maintaining amicable relationships
with retailers might be a challenge, if that SKU increase inconvenienced retailers. PBG had traditionally dictated the
terms of its retailing partnerships. Its products were available in all major retail formats: independent retailers (44.6%),
discount department stores (28.9%), standard department stores (15.2%), and supermarkets (5.5%). PBG was a
leading presence in both moderate prestige (e.g., David Jones, Myer) and discount (e.g., Target, Kmart) department
stores. However, decreased consumer spending had now emboldened retailers to reduce both shelf space and sales
efforts for PBG and other premium brands, in favor of private store brand labels. Gazal challenged Berlei with its range
of well-known licensed fashion brands for the Australian market. In addition to Calvin Klein, Gazal also distributed
Lovable, which also targeted the same premium market segment that PBG would need to support Infinity and
Timeless.
Exhibit 12 provides an overview of the major brands that compete with Berlei in the Australian market. The low-end
private labels are primarily sold in discount outlets, and the high-end brands are sold primarily in lingerie boutiques.
The mid-market brands are sold through both department stores and boutiques. Berlie, Triumph and Elle
Macpherson are the three best-selling brands in Australia. All the brands, except the private labels, are also available
online (e.g., zodee.com.au). Some brands offer more styles (SKUs) online than offline. Berlei, Triumph, and Simone
Perele offer about twice the number of SKUs online than offline, whereas Elle Macpherson offers three times the

number of SKUs online than offline. Some brands offer far fewer SKUs online than offline (Pleasure State (VIP and
Couture)).
Work Politics
Sue had some problems as she got settled in after Fashion Week. First, she was hungry. The growling stomach she
had noticed earlier had not been due to thinking of the failures of Jeff’s tenure as CMO after all. After watching the tiny
and the chic for two days, it dawned on her now that food had been nowhere to be found at Fashion Week, and that
she had not eaten in thirteen hours, despite having just come from a luncheon. In fact, it could only have been
considered “lunch” to a small child. Second, she smiled as she thought about the problem of having a bulldog CFO
watching out for her and simultaneously a CMO who was willing to take big risks to promote the company. She had to
let Mark invest in some strategies of his own, or someone else would lure him away soon. She knew Kevin’s and Mark’s
increasing animosity was largely a manifestation of their loyalties to her and to PBG. She was lucky to have them both,
and she needed to convince Kevin of that. The problem remained, though – as she thought through what food she
might have nearby – that Australian consumers were doing exactly what any sensible consumer would do. In the gloom
of the global slowdown, they were spending less. Sue appreciated Kevin’s conservatism and his challenge to Mark’s
plan to spend for the Timeless and Infinity launches. His concerns were well founded after the “Great Shape Bus”
failure, and the consumer trend toward downward spending was obvious in both the stylish and the sporty lingerie
sectors. She knew Mark could give Kevin what he needed, though.
As she foraged now for a peanut bar she started and was pulled away from eleven days ago, she felt urgency pulling
her to coach Kevin and Mark on how they could all work as a team. Kevin was new to the lingerie business. The
marketer in Sue knew that some industries had opportunities to maintain momentum during hard times, and that
lingerie was one of them. She believed that brassiere shoppers might need a little nudge and some encouragement
to choose Infinity or Timeless, but that they could still be captured. Infinity and Timeless were different enough in
appeal that Sue knew the company needed the quantitative proof a significant segmentation study would give it in
order to understand how to allocate appropriate resources to each line. Mark was right to push for it. Although the
failure of the “Great Shape Bus” campaign to drive sales was one of the key reasons Kevin provided for his strong
refusal to support numerous campaigns for different market segments, Sue felt strongly that she had not
communicated the value proposition of what quantified marketing could do for an organization. This was unfair to him
and Mark, as Mark had been left to defend all campaigns, many times unsuccessfully, to Kevin.
Wrestling the cold peanut bar from its sticky wrapper, Sue decided that enough was enough. “Kevin just needs to
understand our analytics, and that the GSB failed precisely because we tried to broadcast ourselves instead of
segmenting properly ahead of time…before executing the tour.” She vowed, as she noted to find a vending machine
with fresher candy next time she ran out of food that a debacle similar to the “Great Shape Bus” failure would not
repeat on her watch. She also vowed to have her assistant, Josh, buy both officers a set of executive finger paints if
they could not learn to work together like adults.
Consultants’ Brief
To date, Sue had already asked Mark to commission a market research study to gain a better understanding of the
consumer segments, in hopes that such understanding would allow PBG to develop effective segment- or productspecific advertising campaigns. She also wanted to develop deeper relationships with PBG’s retailers, and knowing

consumers’ expectations could suggest some redesigns for “retail experience” factors, such as appropriate store and
shelf displays and retailers’ desired levels of sales and training support. Therefore, PBG could have frank discussions
with its retailers and offer incentives to ensure that retail experience factors would be able to fully support sales of the
fledgling Infinity and Timeless lingerie lines.
As part of a team of consultants hired to analyze the data gathered from the commissioned study, you have access to
a subset of these data for your analysis. The data include variables related to the self-image and personal
characteristics of female shoppers, relevant product-related characteristics, and factors associated with specific retail
situations that might create or enhance satisfaction with the purchase experience. Exhibits 13a and 13b list the
variables about which you have data.
Case Study Questions
Your primary task is to identify and define the segments within the brassiere market and recommend cost-effective
advertising and promotional activities that the Berlei team can execute to promote Infinity and Timeless. As such, you
should consider the following issues:

Question 1
What are the key segments of brassiere shoppers, according to
differences in consumers’ physical, psychological, and retailexperience needs?
Question 2
Does it make sense for PBG to target specific segments to
increase sales for Timeless and Infinity? If so, summarize the
strategic rationale for the segmentation strategy and specify the
segments that PBG should target. If not, explain why not.
Question 3
What specific advertising and retailing programs would allow the
company’s new brassiere offerings, Timeless and Infinity, to
target their potential respective consumers most effectively?
Question 4
Based on your analysis, develop a strategy brief for Sue
Morphet, explaining how she should address the concerns of
her CFO and CMO.
